                        <p>Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner is a heartfelt memoir that explores identity, grief, and the powerful bond between a mother and daughter. Zauner, best known as the lead singer of Japanese Breakfast, reflects on her experiences growing up as a Korean American, the challenges of navigating cultural identity, and the profound loss of her mother to cancer. Through vivid memories and the comfort of Korean food, she illustrates how food can preserve connection, heritage, and love even in the face of sorrow. The book is both a tender tribute to her mother and a moving exploration of resilience and self-discovery.</p>

                    <p>The Hundred Years` War on Palestine is a historical account that reframes the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a century-long colonial struggle rather than a clash between two equal sides. Written by Palestinian-American historian Rashid Khalidi, the book blends scholarship with personal family history to trace six major turning points, beginning with the 1917 Balfour Declaration and continuing through wars, occupations, and peace negotiations. Khalidi argues that these events reflect a sustained campaign of settler colonialism, backed by powerful international allies, while also highlighting the resilience and resistance of the Palestinian people. The book offers both a deeply personal perspective and a broader historical analysis, challenging conventional narratives and emphasizing the enduring consequences of colonialism in the Middle East.</p>

                    <p>The Lioness of Boston is a richly imagined work of historical fiction that tells the life story of Isabella Stewart Gardner, a bold and unconventional art collector who became a major influence in American art and society. Born in New York but transplanted to Boston by marriage, Isabella struggles early on to navigate high society`s rigid expectations. Tragedy strikes—she loses her young son to illness, suffers a miscarriage, and finds herself constrained by societal norms that demand submission rather than vision</p>
